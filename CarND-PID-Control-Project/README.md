# Controls-PID

PID (proportional–integral–derivative controller) is a control loop feedback mechanism. A PID controller continuously calculates an `error` value e(t) as the difference between a desired setpoint (SP) and a measured process variable (PV) and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms. The controller attempts to minimize the error over time by adjustment of a control variable
